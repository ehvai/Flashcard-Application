# Flashcard-Application
Thinkful Capstone - Project Flashcard.

This project is for the 2nd Capstone.

The purpose of the project is to create a flash card app that allows one user to create decks and then look through the deck to study based on the different cards.
This can be used by a single user for self study, or cooperative study where one person writes the cards and another uses them to study with.

The application makes use of React, useState, useEffect, BrowserRouter, Switch, Route, useHistory, useParams, useRouteMatch and API calls.
Additionally, the original file included a list of functions which performed the API calls and were required to be used.  Those files are included in the /utils/api/index.js file.

While formatting was not required for the project, I did add in bootstrap elements so the project would look closer to the screenshots.  It does not include the special bootstrap icons or spacing between the buttons.

The project had some issues related to the ports being used.  The original files had the server using both ports 5000 and 8080 depending on which file you were looking at.  This caused it to not render.  Once fixed, it rendered juts fine.  If when this file is looked at there are issues, check to make sure the ports are set correctly.  They should be!  But just in case.
